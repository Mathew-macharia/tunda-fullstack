# Implementation Summary: Order Management & Notification Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Farmer Order Item Status Update Restrictions**

**File**: `backend/orders/serializers.py` - `OrderItemUpdateSerializer.validate()`

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Payment Validation**: Farmers cannot update order item status until payment is confirmed
- ✅ **Cash on Delivery Exception**: For COD orders, farmers can update status up to "packed" without payment confirmation
- ✅ **Delivery Status Check**: Farmers can only mark items as "delivered" when the delivery status is "delivered"

**Validation Rules**:
```python
# Non-Cash Orders (Mpesa, Bank Transfer)
if not is_cash_on_delivery:
    if order.payment_status != 'paid':
        # ❌ BLOCKED: Cannot update status until payment confirmed

# Cash on Delivery Orders  
if is_cash_on_delivery:
    if item_status == 'delivered':
        if order.delivery.delivery_status != 'delivered':
            # ❌ BLOCKED: Cannot mark as delivered until delivery is delivered
```

**Status Progression**:
- `pending` → `harvested` → `packed` → `delivered`
- Each transition validates the above payment rules

### 2. **Rider Assignment Notifications**

**File**: `backend/delivery/models.py`

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **New Signal Handler**: `send_rider_assignment_notification()`
- ✅ **State Tracking**: Uses `pre_save` signal to track rider assignment changes
- ✅ **Smart Notifications**: Only sends notifications when rider is newly assigned or reassigned

**Notification Triggers**:
```python
# New delivery with rider assigned
if created and instance.rider:
    # Send "assigned" notification

# Existing delivery with rider change
if previous_rider != instance.rider and instance.rider:
    # Send "reassigned" notification
```

**Notification Content**:
- Title: `Delivery Assignment #{delivery_id}`
- Message: Details about order number, value, and delivery location
- SMS option: Respects rider's SMS notification preferences

### 3. **Payment Status Update Authorization**

**Analysis Results** - Who can update payment status:

1. **Admin Users** 
   - Via `AdminOrderViewSet.update_payment_status()` method
   - Manual payment status updates through admin interface

2. **Payment Callbacks**
   - Via `PaymentTransactionViewSet.callback()` method  
   - Automatic updates from payment providers (Mpesa, etc.)

3. **System Automation**
   - Automatic update to "paid" when COD delivery status becomes "delivered"
   - Via `delivery/models.py` signal handler

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files:

1. **`backend/orders/serializers.py`**
   - Enhanced `OrderItemUpdateSerializer.validate()` with payment and delivery checks
   - Added comprehensive validation logic for farmer status updates

2. **`backend/delivery/models.py`**
   - Added `pre_save` signal: `store_previous_delivery_state()`
   - Added `post_save` signal: `send_rider_assignment_notification()`
   - Implemented state tracking for rider assignment changes

## Testing Results

✅ **Payment Validation Tests**:
- Non-cash orders blocked until payment confirmed
- COD orders allowed up to "packed" status
- Delivery status requirement for "delivered" status
- Proper error messages for all validation failures

✅ **Notification System**:
- Rider notifications sent on assignment
- State tracking prevents duplicate notifications  
- Proper error handling for missing communication app

## Business Logic Flow

### Farmer Status Updates:
```
1. Farmer attempts status update
2. Check payment method (COD vs others)
3. If not COD → Require payment_status = 'paid'
4. If COD → Allow up to 'packed', require delivery_status = 'delivered' for final status
5. Validate status progression (pending → harvested → packed → delivered)
6. Update status if all validations pass
```

### Rider Notifications:
```
1. Admin creates/updates delivery record
2. pre_save signal stores current rider state
3. post_save signal compares old vs new rider
4. If rider assigned/changed → Send notification
5. Notification includes order details and delivery location
6. Respects rider's SMS notification preferences
```

## Security & Permissions

- **Farmers**: Can only update their own order items, subject to payment validation
- **Riders**: Receive notifications when assigned, cannot self-assign
- **Admins**: Full control over payment status and delivery assignments
- **System**: Automatic payment updates for COD upon delivery completion

## Error Handling

- **Payment Issues**: Clear error messages about payment requirements
- **Delivery Issues**: Specific error for missing delivery records
- **Notification Failures**: Graceful handling, won't break core functionality
- **Status Transitions**: Validation prevents invalid status changes

All changes maintain backward compatibility while adding the requested business logic constraints.
